- Vague departure explanations

Questions to Probe:

Pattern: Multiple roles < 12 months

Warning Signs:

- No promotions despite years of experience
- Declining company caliber

Mitigating Factors:
- Contract roles (expected short duration)
- Startup failures (company-side issue)
- Relocations (life circumstances)
```

### Employment Gap Analysis
```

< 3 months   | Low        | Job searching, transition
3-6 months   | Medium     | Extended search, personal time
6-12 months  | High       | Career change, health, family
> 12 months  | Very High  | Requires strong explanation
```

### Seniority Regression
```
Pattern: Senior → Mid or Lead → Individual Contributor

Concerning When:
- No explanation provided
- Multiple regressions in history
- Pattern of stepping back

Acceptable When:
- Startup to enterprise transition (title adjustment)
- Career pivot to new field
- Work-life balance choice (explicit)
- Company restructuring/layoffs
```
